<h1>Neo4j Genealogy PlugIn</h1>

Neo4j supports plugins for user defined functions and procedures. This project is developing these for use in genealogy graphs. The pom.xml contained the required dependencies and build parameters. The *.java files will be added as they are developed. In setting up Maven, use the pom.xml and add the desired *.java files; then compile to produce your *.jar file. The default name of the jar is gen-##, where ## is the version number.
