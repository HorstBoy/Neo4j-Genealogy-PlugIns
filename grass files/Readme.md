Grass files are analogous to HTML5 css files. They are useful in extending the native capabilities of the Neo4j Browser. Specifically, you can contril the size, color and text of nodes and edges. To use a grass file, drag and drop it anywhere in the Neo4j browser display or query windows. To see the current grass, use :style in the command window.<br><br>

The priority for formatting is read bottom to top in the grass file. For example, this project uses the same node for Person and DNA_Test labels. If you want the latter to take priority in formatting, its eements must appear blow Person in the grass file. <br><br>
