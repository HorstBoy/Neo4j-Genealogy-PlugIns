	<h2 class="title">Preparing Your Data</h2>
		
		
	Your genealogy data needs to be prepared for this software to import it into Neo4j. This software and the Neo4j PlugIn user defined functions will take your GEDCOM file and create nodes and edges in Neo4j. You will need to have the directory and file name of your GEDCOM.<br><br>
	
	Download your Family Tree DNA (FTDNA) result csv files and organize as follows:.
  <ol>
     <li>The naming of the directories and files is very important. Please assiduously follow the convention outlined here.</li> 
    <li>Create a directory dedicated to your project using a name you select. This is the root directory used by the software.</li> 
    <li>Set up a sub-directory within the root directory for each FTDNA kit whose data you will downloaded. The name of this directory will be used in the Neo4j data, so make it discerable and discrete.</li> 
    <li>Log in to a FTDNA project or to a specific kit and download the following files to the sub-directory you created for the kit. Take care not to modify the name of the downloaded file because its content is parsed to get the kit number and the type of data in the file.</li> 
      <ol type= "a">
        <li>Family Finder matches. Example name: B51965_Family_Finder_Matches_2021-07-20.csv</li> 
        <li>Chromosome browser. Example name: B51965_Chromosome_Browser_Results_20210719.csv</li> 
        <li>Y-DNA matches; not Big Y. Set the view to Y-37 and then download the csv. Example name: 792577_YDNA_Matches_20210125.csv</li> 
        <li>Repeat this process for each kit, using a new sub-directory of the root directory for each. </li> 
      </ol>
	</ol>
