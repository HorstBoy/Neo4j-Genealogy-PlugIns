But, you need a bit of theory to start your journey. Most current methods use relational data systems, base of relational algebra. Graph theory is a distinct arena in mathematics going back to Euler's 1736 solution to the <a class="gfg" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seven_Bridges_of_K%C3%B6nigsberg">Seven Bridges of KÃ¶nigsberg</a>. Euler proved that it was impossible to cross between an island and the other shores while only going over each bridge once. He did this by creating a graph with waypoints and traversals between them, which we now call vertices and edges. Think of a vertex as a noun and an edge as a verb. For Euler, the nodes were <u>places</u> and the egdes were bridges that were <u>crossed</u>. An entirely new field of mathematics was born. Only in the last few decades have databases emerged using graph theory. The first were no-SQL databases, meaning non-relational. But native graph databases are based solely on vertices and edges. Our journey will use Neo4j, which uses the terms nodes and relationships in place of vertex and edge. <br><br>
