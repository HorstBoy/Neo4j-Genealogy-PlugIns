	<b class="title">Project Management</b><br><br>

	GFG software supports multiple projects such as distinct projects for branches of your family tree or for different clients. Each project has a distinct directory with the relevant files. You start an initial or add a new project from the menu: Project &#10132; New Project. Enter the project name and a description which will help you remember its purpose. Click "Add Project" and you will be taken to the project setup page. You can also get to this page to edit and existing project from the menu: Projects &#10132; Open Project. Select the project in the drop down box. You will then see the fields required by the software to identify the database and locate the files. Use the text buttons to the right of each field to get information or navigate to the folder or file. Save or update the information you entered or edited.<br><br>
	
	Finally, you must activate the project. This writes a file, which will be displayed, that the software uses in performing its tasks.<br><br>
	
	You are now ready to load and analyze your data!<br><br>
