	<b class="title">Why Graphs for Genealogists?</b><br><br>
	
	Graphs for Genealogists (GFG) is a package of tools using graph theory to improve genealogy data management and analytics. It is designed to teach genealogists how to think in graphs. This is a transformative process, so prepare yourself to be amazed. Your world view will change.  GFG is designed to make this transformation easier. There is a steep learning curve in fully immersing in graph methods. So, GFG provides a path that bypasses the heavy lifting and gets you directly to results. If you are inspired, you can then take a deeper dive into graph theory and methods.<br><br>
	
	Graphs for Genealogists has user defined functions for loading genealogy data into Neo4j with a schema designed to facilitate genealogy analytics. The primary role of the user is to gather the files, place them in a prescribed folder structure and the start the upload with simple commands. The user is also responsible for curating a template with the link between persons in a GEDCOM file and the DNA kits. While analytics facilitates it, the users also curates the boundaries of triangulation groups which are then used to create autosomal haplotrees and state of the art triangulation reports incorporating matches, paths with specific ancestors and their ahnentafels to identified and phased common ancestors.
	
	Before you dive in, consider what is involved and whether it fits the questions you are pursuing. Graph methods are superior for many problems. But even when they are, there is a cost to change and replacing currently working methods. Here are some items to consider:
	
	<uL>
	<li>Graph methods scale well. The speed of queries will not deteriorate as you add data. If you have large or complex GEDCOMs or lots of DNA kits, you will likely benefit from using these tools</li>
	<li>Traversing graphs is more efficient than joins in relational databases. Not only can you quickly move along branches of a graph, but you can also collect information along the way. For example, genealogy queries traversing a family tree can collect gender to create ahnentafel numbers or patterns for filtering X-linked relatives.</li>
	<li>Queries using Neo4j Cypher language are more intuitive than SQL statements used in relational databases </li>
	<li>Graphs can be augmented to improve performance and simplify querying. For instance, creating edges between ordered sequences of chromosome segments allows queries without directly computing overlaps; this is an efficient strategy.</li>
	
	</uL>
	
	You should consider whether the data available to you justifies the use of new tools. If you have a few DNA kits, you may want to stick with some very good currently available tools. Graphs for Genealogy is well suited for analytics using DNA results from multiple individuals to discover descendants from distant common ancestors who share small segments. It is also well suited for delivering 2- and 3-D visualization graphs incorporating several types of data.<br><br> 
	
	Neo4j is available for free to non-commercial users (e.g., revenue less than $1M/year), such as most genealogists. Neo4j is an open source database, which has enabled developers to augment its capabilities, as we are doing with GFG. While GFG leverages the power of Neo4j, you must install and manage Neo4j independently. <br><br>
	
	Using this software involves stepping through several setup tasks. These should be performed in sequence. Your next steps will be using the links under the Setup menu. Next you must step up your project(s). Neo4j can support multiple databases with one installation. The Projects menu has menu items to allow you to create and edit projects. Once you have completed these steps you can load your data into Neo4 using the Load Data menu items.<br><br>
	
	GFG is also an open source project. The files with the software code and educational materials are freely available at GitHub. If you are interested in actively contributing, please contact us at <a href="mailto:info@wai.md?subject=Graphs for Genealogists Inquiry">info@wai.md</a><br><br>
