	<b>Consider your strategy</b><br><br>
	
	This software and the Neo4j PlugIn are optimized for research on distant ancestors. We have, on average, a 50% chance of inheriting a segment from an ancestor 10 generations back. The same is true of all distant cousins sharing that ancestor, but the odds are small that they share the same segment. However, we have lots of cousins from that distant ancestor and, if you have lots of testers, it is much more likely that you will find shared segments among them. You are also better able to discover small segments which you expect with distant cousins. Graph analytics has the power to discover these segments and distant triangulations. That is the incentive to use these tools.<br><br>
	
	If you create separate projects for different branches of your family you will have some redundancy between projects but less "noise" in each of them. Creating separate projects for each of the surnames of your great grandparents is a reasonable starting point. You will start with only kits from persons sharing that great grandparent as a common ancestor. THe kits will then have matches to other first and second cousins whose kits you cannot access, but most of these will be known to you or easily recognized. The other matches either share the common ancestor or are related through a different branch. If they are matched to several kits at the same segment they are likely relevant. When you evaluate segments, you are looking for those that involve those in your line to the common ancestor and not to known matches in other branches. <br><br>

	The threshold for finding value in these methods is not yet fully defined. But you will probably want at least 10 kits in the project to get a critical number of matches. The correlation between the number of kits and their associated matches will vary in different populations. But the number of matches can be large. For instance is the Teves project we presently have 16 kits and 35,375 matches. In a Stinnett project researching 10-generation ancestors we have 69 kits and 226,998 matches, which is a significant percent of those available at FTDNA. <br><br> 
	

	You should use as many kits as you can get from individuals who triangulate to the line of the common ancestor. That includes those who triangulate to ancestors of the common ancestor in the patrilineal line of the common ancestor's surname. If you want to pursue the matrilineal line of the common ancestor, consider the mother as the starting project of another project. For example, my great grandfather was Rev Jan Teves. The Teves project involves my first and second cousins sharing him as an ancestor. It also includes third, fourth and fifth cousins sharing more distant Teves ancestors. Some of the matches are in Rev Teves' maternal van der Heide line. So, we recruited them to a van der Heide project which, for me, starts at my great great grandparent.<br><br> 
	

<b>Family Tree DNA Results</b><br><br>
	
	You must have full access to the kit at FTDNA to download the required kits. Please adhere to the privacy policies outlined by FTDNA. It is your responsibility to follow these rules and the wishes of the persons whose DNA is being evaluated.  The data will stay on your computer, under your control. None of the steps in this software or in Neo4j involves moving your data into external systems. <br><br>
	
	Your data must be organized in a specific way so that the software can find it, parse it and upload it to Neo4j. The details of that processing are discussed in links under the Load Data menu item. For each kit you will download up to three files. If any are not available, the software will ignore their absence. <br><br>
